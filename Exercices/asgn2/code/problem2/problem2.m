%% Problem 2 - PCA for Face Images

%% 1) Load the images
[data,facedim,nfaces] = load_faces('../../data/yale_faces');

%% 2) Get the principal components by calling compute_pca

%% 3) Plot the cumulative variance

%% 4) Compute the the necessary number of bases with compute_ncomponents.
%%    Display the number of components in the command window.

%% 5) Plot the mean face and the first 10 Eigenfaces by calling display_faces

%% 6a) Choose a face image out of the data with take_face

%% 6b) Make 4 different calls to compute_reconstruction to reconstruct the
%%     chosen image with 5/15/50/150 principal components.

%% 6c) Plot the reconstructions and the original in a single figure with
%%     display_reconstruction.
